# Notes

The demo that is used for all clips in this module in in the folder canary-only.

It is built using a pre-release of React (18.3) and includes the "use" hook. It is only to demonstrate how to create app with Suspense and to understand how promises work.

The goal is that this module is built with standard react client components as not to confuse Next.js and server components with the basics of how Suspense works.
